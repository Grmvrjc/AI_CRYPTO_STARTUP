# NFT Rewards System

## Overview

This document outlines the NFT rewards system for contributors to our decentralized AI startup project. These NFTs represent both recognition of contribution and entitle holders to a share of future project profits.

## NFT Distribution (1000 NFTs Total)

### Initial Allocation
- **420 NFTs (42%)** - Reserved for sales, marketing, and covering non-public parts of the project
- **580 NFTs (58%)** - Allocated for community participants contributing to our primary goal: creating a fully functional MVP and attracting investments of $1M+

### Community NFT Breakdown (580 NFTs)
| Category | NFT Allocation | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Decentralized Agent System Development | 200 NFTs | For creating the prototype of the decentralized agent system, including open-source tools (smart contracts), frameworks, and extensions using our AI system |
| Educational Content Creation | 200 NFTs | For creating courses on Stepik, automation tools for course management (bots for syncing lessons from GitHub to Stepik and communicating with students), media materials, lesson verification, and translations |

- Quality of work is a key factor in determining the final NFT allocation
- The project team reserves the right to adjust the reward system as the project evolves

## Next Steps

Our immediate goals are:
1. Create a working MVP
