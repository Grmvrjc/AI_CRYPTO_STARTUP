## Open Educational Initiative

Welcome to our Open Educational Initiative focused on hands-on learning with AI, blockchain, and Web3 technologies!

This repository serves as a central hub for educational materials, learning resources, and collaborative projects that help you master cutting-edge technologies through practical experience. Our approach is based on learning by doing, where theoretical concepts are immediately applied to realistic projects.

## üîç Connection with ASINGULARITY Project
