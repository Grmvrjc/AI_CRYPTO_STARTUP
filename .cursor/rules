  These rules apply to the entire AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP repository. They outline
  how Cursor AI should assist in the creation, editing, and organization of
  multi-language course materials and other project assets, including references
  to NFT rewards, the startup’s goals, and social media.

      # AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP Repository Rules

      ## 1. Overview
      We are building a real startup, aiming to attract large investments (>= $1M) by developing
      AI, crypto, NFT, and Web3-based technologies, courses, and community content. This repository
      is dedicated to all relevant resources EXCEPT the core code projects, which live in separate repos.

      ### Key Points:
      - Multi-language approach (initially **English** and **Russian**, more in future).
      - README by default in **English**, with a prominent link to other languages.
      - We store documents, instructions, social media content, course outlines, etc.
      - NFT rewards: contributors can earn NFTs that grant a share of future project profits.
      - Additional open-source code (e.g., agent-core, ton-smartcontracts, etc.) is separate from this repo.

      ## 2. Repository Structure

      1. **README.md** (English)  
         - Explains project goals, references to multi-language READMEs for Russian and others.
         - Summarizes how to contribute, links to other subfolders.

      2. **/courses/**  
         - Contains multi-language course outlines, references to Stepik modules/lessons/steps.
         - Example structure:
           ```
           courses/
             russian/
               creating_ai_agents/
                 1_Introduction/
                   1_Greeting/
                     step_1.md
             english/
               creating_ai_agents/
                 ...
           ```
         - Each folder can have subfolders for modules and lessons, each “step” a `.md` file.

      3. **/projects/**  
         - Descriptions of additional sub-projects or synergy tasks (NOT the core code),
           such as plans, concept docs, user guides, etc.

      4. **/social/telegram/content/**  
         - Social media posts, announcements, marketing content in multi-language form.

      5. **.cursor/rules**  
         - This file (or multiple rule files). Contains instructions to unify behavior in the entire repo.

      6. **Other possible directories**  
         - `/media/` or `/assets/` for images, static files
         - `/website/` if building a static site for info
         - etc.

      ## 3. Multi-Language Rules

      - The main README is in English, linking to a `README.ru.md` or similarly named file for Russian.
      - Each course or doc should maintain a parallel folder structure for each language.
      - If editing a doc in one language, eventually we’ll want to add or update the other languages (via separate pull requests or translations).

      ## 4. NFT Rewards & Profit-Sharing

      - Contributors to the project can earn NFTs that entitle them to a share of future revenue.
      - This detail is documented in project docs within the repo, but not relevant to direct code/course generation. 
      - Do not remove or overwrite any references to the NFT or revenue-sharing structures.

      ## 5. Instructions for Cursor AI

      1. When generating or editing documentation:
         - Follow the folder structure, keep multi-language consistency in mind.
         - Provide short, readable sections. Use Markdown headings, bullet points, etc.
      2. Do not publish actual Stepik-specific metadata (like step IDs) to final `.md` files, but do mention where they belong in the step structure.
      3. Keep references to NFT rewards and the startup concept if relevant to the doc.
      4. Linking to code: mention the separate repositories (e.g., `agent-core`) if needed.
      5. For translations: If user requests, generate a parallel `.md` in the correct language subfolder. 
      6. For marketing or social media text, place it in `/social/telegram/content/` or the relevant subfolder if the user requests. 
      7. All final text will be reviewed manually before merging. If unsure, produce multiple suggestions.

      ## 6. Project-Rule Scopes & Patterns

      - Applies to **all** folders/files within the AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP repo (`pattern: "**/*"`).
      - If additional specialized rules are created (e.g., for code-lint or content-lint), they will appear in separate `.cursor/rules/*.yaml` with narrower patterns.

      ## 7. Conclusion
      This file unifies how Cursor AI interacts with the AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP repo. Adhere to the structure, multi-language guidelines, references to NFT-based rewards, and our overall mission of building a real crypto-AI startup with Stepik-based courses. Collaborators will appreciate consistent formatting, style, and bilingual support.
