      # AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP Repository Rules

      ## 1. Overview
      We are building a real startup, aiming to attract large investments (>= $1M) by developing
      AI, crypto, NFT, and Web3-based technologies, courses, and community content. This repository
      is dedicated to all relevant resources EXCEPT the core code projects, which live in separate repos.

      ### Key Points:
      - Our ecosystem is named **ASINGULARITY AI** (domain: ASINGULARITY.AI), combining "ASI" (Artificial Superintelligence) and "Singularity", reflecting our ultimate goal of building advanced AI systems.
      - Multi-language approach (initially **English** and **Russian**, more in future).
      - README by default in **English**, with a prominent link to other languages.
      - We store documents, instructions, social media content, course outlines, etc.
      - NFT rewards: contributors can earn NFTs that grant a share of future project profits.
      - Additional open-source code (e.g., agent-core, ton-smartcontracts, etc.) is separate from this repo.
      - **All filenames must be in English**, even if the content is in another language.

      ## 2. Repository Structure

      1. **README.md** (English) and **README.ru.md** (Russian)  
         - Explains project goals, with cross-references between language versions.
         - Summarizes how to contribute, links to other subfolders.
         - Uses attractive formatting with emojis, tables, and blockquotes.

      2. **ABOUT.md** (English) and **ABOUT.ru.md** (Russian)
         - Detailed project description, vision, and goals.
         - Information about NFT rewards and profit-sharing.
         - Links to contribution guidelines and community resources.

      3. **/community/**

         - Example structure:
           ```
           courses/
             ru/
               AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP/
                 DESCRIPTION.md
                 MODULE_1_INTRODUCTION/
                   LESSON_1_OVERVIEW/
                     STEP_1_GREETING.md
                     STEP_2_GOALS.md

             en/
               AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP/
                 DESCRIPTION.md
                 MODULE_1_INTRODUCTION/
                   LESSON_1_OVERVIEW/
                     STEP_1_GREETING.md
           ```
         - Each folder can have subfolders for modules and lessons, each "step" a `.md` file.

      5. **/projects/**  
         - Descriptions of additional sub-projects or synergy tasks (NOT the core code),
           such as plans, concept docs, user guides, etc.

      11. **.cursor/rules**  
          - This file (or multiple rule files). Contains instructions to unify behavior in the entire repo.

      ## 3. Multi-Language Rules

      - The main README is in English, with a parallel `README.ru.md` for Russian.
      - Each document should have language-specific versions with consistent naming:
        - English: `DOCUMENT_NAME.md`
        - Russian: `DOCUMENT_NAME_RU.md`
      - **All filenames must be in English**, even for non-English content.
      - Each course or doc should maintain a parallel folder structure for each language.
      - If editing a doc in one language, eventually we'll want to add or update the other languages (via separate pull requests or translations).

      ## 4. NFT Rewards & Profit-Sharing

      - Contributors to the project can earn NFTs that entitle them to a share of future revenue.
      - NFT distribution follows the structure outlined in `/community/rewards/NFT_REWARDS_SYSTEM.md`:
        - 42% profit share up to $1,000
        - 23% up to $2,000
        - 16% up to $5,000
        - 15% up to $10,000
        - 8% up to $50,000
        - 4% up to $100,000
      - When receiving major investments ($1,000,000+), each NFT holder will receive $100 (USDT or equivalent).
      - NFTs also provide privileges and access to platform services.
      - Do not remove or overwrite any references to the NFT or revenue-sharing structures.

      ## 5. Contribution Guidelines

      - Contributors should follow the process outlined in `/community/CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md`:
        1. Create a contributor profile in `/community/contributors/`
        2. Submit a Pull Request for approval
        3. Work on tasks and earn NFT rewards
      - Contributions are evaluated based on quality, impact, complexity, originality, and alignment with project goals.
      - Various types of contributions are welcome: code, educational content, design, content, testing, community support, and ideas.

      ## 6. Formatting and Style

      - Use attractive formatting with emojis, tables, blockquotes, and clear headings.
      - For README files and important documents, use:
        - Emojis for section headings
        - Blockquotes (>) for important messages
        - Tables for structured data (like NFT reward distribution)
        - Clear hierarchical headings (###) for better organization
      - Keep content concise, engaging, and visually appealing.

      ## 7. Branding and Ecosystem Name

      - Our ecosystem is officially named **ASINGULARITY AI**.
      - The name combines "ASI" (Artificial Superintelligence) and "Singularity", representing our vision to build advanced AI systems that approach technological singularity.
      - The official domain is **ASINGULARITY.AI**.
      - When referring to the project in documentation, marketing materials, or code:
        - Use the full name "ASINGULARITY AI" in headers, titles, and first mentions
        - You can use "ASINGULARITY" in subsequent mentions
        - Always maintain the capitalization: "ASINGULARITY" (all caps), not "Asingularity" or "ASingularity"
      - The ecosystem name should be prominently featured in:
        - Website headers and footers
        - Documentation introductions
        - Course materials
        - Social media profiles and content
        - Marketing materials
      - When creating logos or visual assets, maintain consistent branding with the ASINGULARITY AI name.

      ## 8. Instructions for Cursor AI

      1. When generating or editing documentation:
         - Follow the folder structure, keep multi-language consistency in mind.
         - Provide short, readable sections. Use Markdown headings, bullet points, etc.
         - Use attractive formatting with emojis, tables, and blockquotes where appropriate.
      2. Do not publish actual Stepik-specific metadata (like step IDs) to final `.md` files, but do mention where they belong in the step structure.
      3. Keep references to NFT rewards and the startup concept if relevant to the doc.
      4. Linking to code: mention the separate repositories (e.g., `agent-core`) if needed.
      5. For translations: If user requests, generate a parallel `.md` in the correct language subfolder. 
      6. For marketing or social media text, place it in `/social/telegram/content/` or the relevant subfolder if the user requests. 
      7. All final text will be reviewed manually before merging. If unsure, produce multiple suggestions.
      8. **Always create filenames in English**, even when the content is in Russian or another language.
      9. For Russian-language content, add "_RU" suffix to the filename (e.g., `DOCUMENT_NAME_RU.md`).

      ## 9. Project-Rule Scopes & Patterns

      - Applies to **all** folders/files within the AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP repo (`pattern: "**/*"`).
      - If additional specialized rules are created (e.g., for code-lint or content-lint), they will appear in separate `.cursor/rules/*.yaml` with narrower patterns.

      ## 10. Conclusion
      This file unifies how Cursor AI interacts with the AI_CRYPTO_STARTUP repo. Adhere to the structure, multi-language guidelines, references to NFT-based rewards, and our overall mission of building a real crypto-AI startup with Stepik-based courses. Collaborators will appreciate consistent formatting, style, and bilingual support. Remember that all filenames must be in English, regardless of content language.

      Always refer to our ecosystem by its official name **ASINGULARITY AI**, which embodies our vision of creating Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) and working toward technological singularity. This branding should be consistently applied across all project materials to build a recognizable and unified identity for our ambitious venture.
